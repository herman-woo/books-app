# My Reads App
This is my submission for the first project of my REACT course from Udacity.

## Application Setup
Application requires `npm install` and `npm start` to be launched

## Main Functionality
This app helps users manage their own reading list.
There are 2 pages to this app:
1. Home Page
2. Search Page


## Home Page
The home page of this app allows a user to see books under three different categories, represented in 3 'shelves'. They are the following:
1. "Currently Reading" 
2. "Want to Read"
3. "Read"

### Moving Books
To move one book from one shelf to another, click the green icon on the desired book to see a small drop down menu. Click on the deisred shelf to place the book in to from the dreop down menu.

## Search Page
This page can be accessed through the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner.

### Search Bar
Here the user may type in the name of a desired book into the text field at the top of the page and results will appear below.

### Serach Results
If the search input matches the names of any books library, it will be displayed.
Users can still change the shelf of a book from these results displayed here.

### Return Button
Directs user back to home page
